        We, HelperPlace, are a team of ethical professionals dedicated to the betterment of the 
        foreign domestic workers. Founded in 2016, our online platform is designed to assist the
         employers as well as the helpers by enabling them to make informed decisions. 
         Our working method is simple and straight; we connect helpers and employers seamlessly,
         providing both of them a fair recruitment experience. Gone are the days when the 
         domestic helpers were required to pay unethical, hefty fees to the employment agencies.
         At HelperPlace, we are committed to providing instant access to both the parties 
         through well structured profiles,screening and a streamlined hiring process.
